# Lighthouse Bistro

Lighthouse Bistro is a food-ordering app that allows customers to purchase food and drinks from a fictitious restaurant, whereby the customer will receive live text message updates from the restaurant for when the order is received, delayed, or ready for pick up.

## Features

### Designed for both Customers and Restaurant Owners

Customers are presented with the restaurant's menu and ordering options, while restaurant owners are presented with a order page showing all incoming orders, as well as the ability to change the ETA for those orders.

### Live Text Message Updates

Using Twilio, both the restaurant and the customer receive live text message updates whenever an order is placed, ETA change, and ready for pick up.
